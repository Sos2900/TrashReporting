Client wants a program with which civilians can report trash piling up. 
Users can take a picture of the trash site and send it to the admins with a description and a severity level.
I'm still working on starting on the project, so not many features are available.
I'm also thinking of implementing google's api to get coordinates of the picture, so I can create a map of the trash sites for the admin with each ping on the corresponding location with a color based on the
severity level.
